# if they move or take damage, the teleport will be canceled. If set to TRUE, the teleport will run even if the person walks or runs.

# =========================================== COMMANDS SETTINGS ===========================================

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# COMMAND ENTRY TIP:
# The label before the curly brace (e.g., 'home' in 'home: {...}') is an
# internal identifier for this configuration entry. It must be unique but can be
# any text (e.g., 'my_home_cooldown' or 'warp-to-spawn').
#
# IMPORTANT: This label defines the permission for players to bypass the cooldown:
# cct.ignore.[label].
# The actual command executed in-game (e.g., '/home') is defined by the 'command' field.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This section will contain the commands that the counter will take effect on
commands:
  home: {
    # It is not necessary to start with "/", as the plugin will add it automatically
    command: "home",
    # Seconds that will affect this command
    seconds: 5
  }
  tpa: {
    command: "tpa",
    seconds: 4
  }
  tpahere: {
    command: "tpahere",
    seconds: 4
  }
  spawn: {
    command: "spawn",
    seconds: 5
  }
  warp: {
    command: "warp",
    seconds: 5
  }

# This option makes the global counter affect all commands, including those not listed in the commands section
global_command: false
# In this section you set the time in seconds for the global counter
global_seconds: 6

# This section will contain the commands that will NOT be affected when "global_command" is set to TRUE
whitelist_commands: [
  "home",
  "spawn"
]

# The permissions for players are: cct.ignore.all, cct.ignore.home, cct.ignore.tpa, cct.ignore.tpahere, cct.ignore.spawn, cct.ignore.warp (The appropriate permissions will be added for the command added in "commands". If the command "warp" is added (for example), only cct.ignore.warp will be created.)
# Custom Cooldown Teleport has support for multiple languages like Spanish, English (The available languages are listed above)
